# JavaScript Bug: Handling Null and Undefined Values

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error and its solution. The `bug.js` file contains a function that attempts to access the `length` property of a variable that might be `null` or `undefined`. This results in a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')`. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the function with appropriate error handling.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bug.js` with a null or undefined value as input. 

## Solution

The bug is solved in `bugSolution.js` by explicitly checking for `null` and `undefined` values before accessing the `length` property. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring.  The improved error handling makes the code more robust.
